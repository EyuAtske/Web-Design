            <td>Porsche is one of the most iconic luxury car manufacturers in the world,
                renowned for its precision engineering, performance, and timeless design. 
                Founded in 1931 by Ferdinand Porsche in Stuttgart, Germany, the brand 
                originally focused on automotive development and consulting before producing
                its own vehicles. The company’s first car, the Porsche 356, debuted in 
                1948 and quickly set the tone for what would become a legacy of innovation,
                blending lightweight construction with powerful engines and superb handling.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Over the years, Porsche has continued to refine its reputation for excellence 
                with legendary models like the 911, introduced in 1964. The 911 remains a 
                symbol of sports car perfection, evolving through decades while maintaining 
                its distinctive shape and rear-engine layout. Beyond sports cars, Porsche 
                expanded its lineup to include SUVs such as the Cayenne and Macan, and the 
                luxury four-door Panamera, broadening its appeal while maintaining its performance 
                heritage. This balance of luxury, power, and practicality has helped Porsche attract 
                a loyal global fan base.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>In recent years, Porsche has embraced the future of mobility through electrification 
                and sustainability. The introduction of the fully electric Taycan marked a major step 
                toward combining cutting-edge technology with Porsche’s racing DNA. Despite moving 
                into the electric era, Porsche remains dedicated to its founding principles — delivering 
                driving pleasure, exceptional craftsmanship, and innovation. Whether on the racetrack 
                or the open road, Porsche continues to embody the spirit of performance and engineering 
                excellence that has defined it for nearly a century.</td>
